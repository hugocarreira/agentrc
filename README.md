# AI Agent Setup - Centralized

**Single source of truth for opencode, codex, claude**

Philosophy: Just talk to it. Give agent way to verify. Ship fast.

---

## Quick Setup

```bash
cd ~/work/agent
./scripts/setup-symlinks.sh
```

Creates symlinks:
```
~/.config/opencode/  → ~/work/agent/stacks/opencode/
~/.codex/            → ~/work/agent/stacks/codex/
~/.claude/           → ~/work/agent/stacks/claude/
skills/              → ~/work/agent/skills/ (all stacks)
```

---

## Structure

```
~/work/agent/
├── AGENTS.md              # Core rules (start here!)
├── QUICK-REFERENCE.md     # Daily cheatsheet
├── RTK.md                 # Token optimization
│
├── skills/                # 32 reusable workflows
├── stacks/                # Stack-specific configs
├── research/              # Deep research (optional reading)
└── setup-symlinks.sh
```

## Usage

### Daily Workflow
```bash
# Agent reads:
# 1. ~/work/agent/AGENTS.md (core rules)
# 2. ~/work/agent/RTK.md (token optimization)  
# 3. Project's AGENTS.md (if exists)
# 4. Your code

# Just talk:
"add login button"
"[screenshot] fix padding"
"look at ../other-project and do same"
```

### Add to Projects

```bash
cd ~/work/agent
./scripts/setup-project.sh
# Interactive: asks project name + option (new/existing)
```

## Core Principles

**#1 Give Agent Way to Verify (HIGHEST LEVERAGE!)**

- Benchmarks with clear criteria

**#2 Context is Precious**
- /clear between tasks
- /clear after 2 corrections

**#3 Just Talk To It**
- Short prompts + screenshots
- Natural conversation

**#4 Final Manual Review**
- Always understand what agent did
- Never ship without review
